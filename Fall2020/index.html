<header>TTIC 31230: Fundamentals of Deep Learning</header>

<p>Autumn 2020</p>

<p>Lecture: David McAllester</p>

<p>TA: Pedro Savarese</p>

<p>This class is intended to provide students with an understanding of the technical content of current
research in deep learning. Students successfully completing the class should be able to read and understand
current deep learning research papers and posses the technical knowledge necessary to both reproduce
research results and to do original research in deep learning.  The course covers current methods in computer vision,
natural language processing and reinforcement learning for games and robotics. One of the
amazing aspects of deep learning is that much the conceptual knowledge needed for research in these areas is shared
among the areas making such broad coverage possible. </p>


<p>The official meeting time is MWF 1:50-2:40.  However, this will be an on-line class and
recorded lectures will be available in advance.  The class time will be used for on-line office hours (by zoom)
for Prof. McAllester.</p>

<!--- The grade will be based on five problem sets (20/% of grade) and five timed quizzes (80% of grade)
which will occur in lieu of lecture every other Wednesday.  Problem set and quiz solutions can be done
on pencil and paper and photographed for electronic submission to Canvas. -->
